- [X] Create the directory ```./circleci``` and the file ```.circleci/config.yml``` in your project and push that change to your GitHub repository.
- [X] Create the file ```Dockerfile``` in the root of your project and include the contents of the file as described in the instructions. Push that change to your GitHub repository.
- [X] Write the URL of your app hosted on digitalocean here:  
> Example: [https://cis411-lab4-x4fv7.ondigitalocean.app/graphql](https://cis411-lab4-x4fv7.ondigitalocean.app/graphql)
- [X] Embed _using markdown_ a screenshot of your successful deployed application to Heroku.  
> Example: ![Successful Build](assets/../../assets/Screenshot2.jpg)
- [x] Embed _using markdown_ a screenshot of your successful build and deployment to digitalocean of your project (with the circleci interface).

- [x] Submit a Pull Request to cis411_lab4_CD and provide the URL of that Pull Request in Canvas as your URL submission.

## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
> Containers are a smaller and lighter way to run product testing for instances and operating systems than spinning up VM or testing on full blown operating systems.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to digital ocean, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> I think they have a bunch of crossover content but there is advantages to each. Circleci automates workflows and helps streamline development. Digitalocean offers quicker server deployments and scales well.
3. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> It has the ability to run multiple instances of the applications and has only the code needed to run the application and there fore does not take as many resources.
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
> Cloud Foundry: an open-source cloud application platform suppoting most popular programming languages and developer frameworks. 
> Containerd: an open-source daemon working as an interface between a container engine and container runtimes supported by both Linux and Window.
> CoreOS rkt: pronounced "rocket" and it offers better security than docker. It's great for rapid deployment and public cloud portability.
> Windows Hyper-V containers:  not open source, but compatible with open-sourced solutions and offer higher levels of isolation and portability.
> Kubernetes: open-source container management runtime environment used to automate deployment, scaling, and management. The platform has a considerable following and is used by well-known companies like eBay, Pokemon GO, Yahoo, and Zulily.
