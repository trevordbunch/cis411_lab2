## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
> With the container all of the members of the project would be able to run the applications without the need of downloading a lot of programs. 
2. If we have the ability to publish a directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> CiscleCi is like a middle man. Before the code goes live it goes through CircleCi so it can be tested to make sure that the code is deployable. It checks to make sure that there are no errors.
3. Why would you use container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> The VM is much longer to set up, also VM takes a lot of OS resources. So, a lot of disc space would be saved if using the container. Also, there is no virtualization needed with Docker since it runs directly on the host OS.
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
