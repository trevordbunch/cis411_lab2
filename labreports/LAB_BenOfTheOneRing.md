## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?

> Because containerized applications contain all of their own data and app/file versions. This way if two devs have different versions of npm, git, or some other necessary file or service, those differences do not leak into errors with the app if the app is deployed to a different environment. 
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> It checks for errors and makes sure the app can actually run. This saves valuable time in troubleshooting, and also acts as a fail-safe in-case a dev accidentally sends a broken build to the deployed server. CircleCI would block that type of dangerous deployment. 
3. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> Because a virtual machine, while it would stop your personal device from being harmed from errors, would still have environments that would most likely not match with every user's systems and environments. If an app fully contains its own dependencies then it does not matter what device it is used on. 
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
> Cloud Foundry, Containerd, CoreOS rkt, Kubernetes
