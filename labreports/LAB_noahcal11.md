## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
> Containers package an application and all of its dependencies into one portable unit. If I test locally, my application may work on my machine but cause errors on someone else's. By running in a container, the entire team can develop in the same reliable environment.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> CI solutions allow for automation and feedback. Automating the building, testing, and deployment processes allows developers to focus elsewhere rather than configuring deployment settings. CI tools also provide much faster feedback on when code changes cause issues so developers can fix issues sooner. These allow for greater scalability as applications grow in complexity and size.
3. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> Containers are much more efficent than VMs. They use the native OS instead of a separate one, meaning they require much less resources. They can run on any machine that supports the container runtime. It is both more cost and time efficent to use containers over VMs.
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
> Alternatives to Docker include Podman, CRI-O (for Kubernetes), LXC/LXD (for Linux), rkt, and OpenVZ
