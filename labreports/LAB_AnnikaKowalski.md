## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
    - A container allows members working on the project to run the application without needing to install/download any other software or programs. The container also contains all of the programs/dependencies needed for the program to run. 
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
    - CircleCI is the middle man for the project. It tests and deploys the program to ensure that it is working properly. It also allows multiple ensures to push their code before it goes live on Heroku. 
3. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
    - Containers are used more often than virtual machines because containers take up less space than the virtual machines do. Virtual machines are often times more dependant and typically also take longer to set up than container do. 
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
    - Some alternatives to Docker are LXD, rkt and Mesos.
