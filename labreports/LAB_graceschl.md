## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
> A containerized version of an application is beneficial because it allows all of the members of a project to the application without having to download a bunch of other programs. The container then holds all of the dependencies needed to run the project.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> Programs like CircleCI allow for the code to be tested for errors before deploying it. This way, if the code is not deployable, the program will tell us and the errors can be fixed.
3. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> Virtual machines typically take a lot longer to set up than container technology because container technologies require a lot less resources. 
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
> [Podman](https://podman.io/), [LXD](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/), and [rkt](https://cloud.redhat.com/learn/topics/rkt)
