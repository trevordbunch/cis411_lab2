## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
> A containerized version of an application is beneficial because it provides a barrier between the application and the host system. Any dependencies that the application may have is contained withing the container. Another benefit is scalability as containers can be easily be scaled to fit the demands of the application.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> The benefit that CircleCI provides is automation, scalability, and continuous feedback. This takes the burden off developers so they don't need to follow every step of the development process. CircleCI will help with testing the code and providing quick feedback and then send code into deployment. 
1. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> Container technology is a better choice because they provide resource efficiency, higher density, and consistent environment. The container technology shares the host operating system kernel and don't require a separate OS unlike the virtual machine. You can also run multiple containers on a single host and container also provide consistent runtime environment regardless of the OS versions.
1. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
> Some alternatives to Docker are OpenVZ, Podman, Kubernetes, and rkt. While all these alternatives are similar to Docker they provide their own unique benefits. For example load-balancing, non-root user containers for increased security, and auto scaling.
