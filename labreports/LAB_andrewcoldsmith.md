## Questions
1. Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
> The application may work on my computer, but that doesn't guarantee it will work on other computers. With containerization, everything the application is dependent on is kept in boxes that can be moved with the project to a new system.
2. If we have the ability to publish directory to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
> CircleCI runs tests on files when they are published and recognizes problems. This prevents developers from publishing broken code or incorrect files.
3. Why would you use a container technology over a virtual machine(VM)?
> Containers require far less storage than virtual machines. Also, they can easily be moved to any computer while VMs need to be set up on a system before the transferred application can be used.
4. What are some alternatives to Docker for containerized deployments?
> A few other popular containerizing software include AWS Fargate, Linux Containers (LXC), and Microsoft Azure.
